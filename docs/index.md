_Do you want to save the Instagram Stories of your favorite celebrities, influencers, or friends to your Google Drive?_ This project shows you how to do that with a simple tool that runs on Google Sheets. You just need to enter the Instagram usernames of the people you want to follow, and the tool will automatically download their latest Stories to your Drive. No coding or technical skills required!

{% include toc.md %}

## Introduction

Instagram Stories are ephemeral posts that disappear after 24 hours. They are a popular way for users to share their daily moments, thoughts, and opinions with their followers. However, sometimes you may want to save the Stories of your favorite celebrities, influencers, or friends to your Google Drive for later viewing, analysis, or backup.

This project uses Google Apps Script and Google Sheets to create a cloud-based tool that downloads the most recent Instagram Stories of any user you specify and saves them to your Google Drive. With this tool, you can:

- Enter the Instagram usernames and IDs of the people you want to download Stories from in a Google Sheet.
- Set up a time-driven trigger to run the script automatically at regular intervals.
- Customize the code to suit your needs and use it to access and automate various Google services, such as Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Sheets.

This project is open-source and free to use. You can find the source code, the Google Sheet template, and the detailed instructions on how to use the tool on this website. You can also check out the project GitHub repository for more information and reporting issues.

## üõπ How to Use

{:style="background:lightyellow;padding:1rem"}
Starting from Build 2021.11.10, the Apps Script has been redesigned to work with a Google Sheet file as a user interface.

Make a copy of our Google Sheet template to your Google Drive by clicking the button below.

<div style="margin: 1.5rem">
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1td-CfE5NWHtKSeAMo32rPYQOZC5ydX9BXnXtumzYnL8/copy">
    <amp-img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Sheet-34a853?logo=googlesheets&logoColor=white" width="185" height="36" layout="fixed" alt=""></amp-img>
  </a>
</div>

The spreadsheet contains the following three sheets:

1. **Subscriptions**
: A table for you to list the Instagram users and their IDs that you want to subscribe to.

2. **Logs**
: A log sheet of file download activities.

3. **Settings**
: A tabular form for you to fill in the values of options and parameters for running the script.

You can use the Google Sheet file and bound our script to it in the following ways:

| Method                                                                                                        | Descriptions                                                                                                                                                                                      | Remarks                                                                                                          |

### üì© Set Up Subscriptions

Add the name and ID of your target Instagram user accounts to the table on the page "Subscriptions"

The **Instagram User ID** is necessary to query the data of the target Instagram user from the official web API. You can look up the ID with username by using [the ID finder powered by The Code of a Ninja](https://codeofaninja.com/tools/find-instagram-user-id).

For example, label **bbcnews** as the name in the first column and put its ID **16278726** in the second column to subscribe to the stories from [BBC News's Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/bbcnews/).

It will fetch the photos and videos from Instagram and upload them to your Google Drive folder if it finds any new stories from the listed accounts when you click on the <kbd>‚ñ∂Run</kbd> button.

## ‚ùì FAQ
